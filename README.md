## Languages

There are a number of ways you can interact with the micro:bit depending what you are comfortable with.

### Blocks

You can write blocks code on the [make code website](https://makecode.microbit.org/)

Blocks is a simplification of programming with the micro:bit and a great place to start if you are new to programming. Some operations that would usually be complex have already been encapsulated into function blocks, making things like radio and bluetooth communication much easier.

#### Blocks JavaScript

Blocks is essentially just javascript code, if you press the Javascript switch you can start editing the code directly

### Python

Write python code for the micro:bit [in the browser](https://python.microbit.org/v/1.1) or [download the Mu editor](http://codewith.mu).

Python makes operations like parsing large amounts of data and writing data to files quite trivial. If your project involves saving a lot of data, think about writing in python

### Arduino

You can write for the micro:bit from the Arduino IDE. If you already know C++ or would like to learn more about using the Arduino platform, this may be a good place to start.

[There is a fairly comprehensive guide to setting up the micro:bit for use with the Arduino IDE at Adafruit's Website](https://learn.adafruit.com/use-micro-bit-with-arduino/overview). This is still being developed so some functions may not be available with the Arduino IDE that are available with other programming languages.
